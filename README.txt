# Project Name

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of **SOLID principles** to achieve clean, maintainable, and scalable code. By adhering to these principles, the codebase becomes more flexible, easier to extend, and simpler to test.

## SOLID Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.

- **Example**: In our project, each class is focused on a single responsibility. For instance, the `UserService` handles user-related operations, while the `EmailService` deals with sending emails.
- **Benefit**: This keeps classes focused, small, and easier to maintain.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Definition**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

- **Example**: We achieve this by using interfaces and abstract classes. For example, adding new payment methods only requires implementing a new class without modifying existing code.
- **Benefit**: This allows the system to grow without risking existing functionality.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Definition**: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

- **Example**: All implementations of the `Database` interface can be used interchangeably without altering the behavior of the `UserService`.
- **Benefit**: This ensures that the system is robust and that new subclasses do not break existing functionality.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Definition**: Use small, client-specific interfaces rather than one large, general-purpose interface.

- **Example**: Instead of forcing all classes to implement a large interface, we split it into smaller, more specific ones, such as `Worker` and `Eater`.
- **Benefit**: This reduces the impact of changes and makes classes easier to implement and maintain.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions.

- **Example**: The `UserService` depends on the `Database` interface rather than concrete implementations like `MySQLDatabase` or `PostgresDatabase`.
- **Benefit**: This allows easy switching of database implementations and simplifies unit testing by using mocks.

## Benefits of Using SOLID Principles
- **Maintainability**: The code is easier to understand, modify, and extend.
- **Scalability**: The system can grow without causing cascading changes throughout the codebase.
- **Testability**: Loose coupling makes it easier to write unit tests, improving code quality.
